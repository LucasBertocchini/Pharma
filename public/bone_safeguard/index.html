                        The term "osteoporosis" comes from Latin for "porous bones."
                        A healthy bone has small spaces like a honeycomb.
                        Osteoporosis increases the size of these spaces,
                        causing the bone to lose strength and density while
                        the outside of the bone grows weaker and thinner.
                        Our bones are living tissue that is constantly being resorbed and reformed.
                        Osteoporosis results when more bone is resorbed than reformed (Martin 2009, Body 2011).
                        When we are younger, this turnover happens quickly, making our bones dense and strong.
                        As we get older, the process slows, and our bones lose mass faster than it can be replaced.
                    </p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p style="margin: 32px; margin-top: 64px;">
                        Anyone who is losing height with age may have osteoporosis.
                        Unfortunately, osteoporosis typically has no symptoms until a serious fracture occurs,
                        usually from a relatively minor injury (Azagra 2011).
                        Fully one third of those affected by the condition are males.
                        About half of American women and 25% of American men over 50
                        will break a bone due to osteoporosis (Bone Health, Ahmed 2009).
                        Within a year of suffering a hip fracture, more than 20% of
                        patients may die (Osteoporosis Foundation, Panula 2011).

                        Prevention of osteoporosis is a much better choice than treatment.
                        Therefore, it is essential to take all measures to prevent the disease.
                        We recommend the strategic use of nutritional supplements to restore and maintain our bones.
                        Our supplement regimen goes beyond simple recommendations for calcium and vitamin D.
                        Combinations of nutrients are required for bone health (Genuis 2012).
                        For example, both vitamin D and magnesium are necessary for proper calcium deposition and bone development.
                        Using single supplemental vitamins or minerals in isolation may not be successful.
                        Using nutrients in combination may work much better (Rude 2004).

                        A scientist at the National Cancer Institute named Herbert Sprince, PhD.
                        found that when rodents were given an "LD-90" dose of acetaldehyde
                        (the amount that would typically kill 90% of the animals)
                        and were also given vitamins B1 and C and cysteine,
                        these toxic effects were blocked entirely-none of the treated
                        animals succumbed to the deadly dose of acetaldehyde.
                        <span class="reference Sprince-1975 left"><a href="#Sprince-1975-reference">[38]</a></span>
                        Another study found that taking cysteine resulted in a reduction in hangovers,
                        nausea, and headache following alcohol consumption,
                        as well as reduced stress and anxiety.

                        Eggs are the best source of the amino acid cysteine,
                        and orange juice is an excellent source of vitamin C.
                        An old folk remedy for hangovers was to drop a raw egg
                        into a glass of orange juice and attempt to swill it down.
                        Now that we have discovered the active ingredients in eggs and OJ,
                        we no longer have to resort to this revolting remedy!

                        We need to take about 200 mg of cysteine for every alcoholic
                        drink to block most of the toxic effects of acetaldehyde.
                        This is the amount of cysteine contained in each
                        Alcohol Safeguard pill-plus the same amount of vitamin C,
                        which is required to keep the cysteine in its activated state and
                        "on the job" against acetaldehyde. <span class="reference Eriksson-2020 center"><a href="#Eriksson-2020-reference">[7]</a></span>

                        Vitamin D is essential for bone health.
                        It is crucial for calcium absorption,
                        and it helps regulate how much calcium
                        enters and leaves bone tissue (Chen 2019).
                        Many people obtain vitamin D through sunlight exposure.
                        But this can be difficult during the winter and for
                        those who spend most of their time indoors (Chen 2019).
                        It is estimated that 50% of the population has low levels of vitamin D (Sizar 2022).

                    Low vitamin D and calcium intake are well-known causes of osteoporosis
                    (Cherniack 2008, Lips 2010).
                    One study including 400 older adults found that people with
                    osteoporosis were more likely to be deficient in vitamin D.
                    A daily vitamin D supplement was linked to a lower incidence of osteoporosis
                    (Shahnazari 2019).

                    To reduce the risk of bone fractures and ensure sufficient blood levels,
                    research suggests that a dose of 400-800 IU of vitamin D per day may be sufficient
                    (Reid 2019, Burt 2019).

                        <p>
                            Like vitamin D, vitamin K2 plays a crucial role in keeping calcium where it belongs,
                            in our bones, and out of our blood vessels, which can cause calcium deposits in our arteries.
                            People with lower vitamin K levels are at increased risk for calcification (hardening) of the arteries
                            (Okura 2010).
                            Increasing your calcium intake can be counterproductive if you are not getting enough vitamin K2.
                            Without enough K2, excess calcium will remain in your bloodstream,
                            which can cause high blood pressure and heart disease.
                            Studies using the data from tens of thousands of people have shown that those
                            with high intakes of vitamin K2 are far less likely to die of heart disease.
                            In one study, they were 57% less likely
                            (Geleijnse 2004).
                            Our advice: If you are taking a calcium supplement without adequate intake
                            of vitamins K2 and D in your diet or through supplementation: Stop!

                            For decades, doctors in Japan have been using high doses of vitamin K2 as
                            a prescription drug to prevent bone loss and protect against fractures.
                            It is now available in the U.S. without a prescription.

                            Vitamin K2 is important in maintaining bone strength and preventing bone breakdown.
                            It is essential for building the protein matrix that traps calcium crystals in bone
                            (Bugel 2008).
                            Low levels of vitamin K have been associated with an increased risk of bone fractures and low bone density
                            (Akbari 2018, Rodriguez 2019, Apalset 2011).

                            Vitamin K2 has been shown to support bone health when used as a supplement
                            (Bunyaratavej 2009, Sato 2002).
                            Vitamin K2 supplementation improved bone mineral density and
                            significantly reduced rates of fractures - including hip fractures
                            (Cockayne 2006).
                            A 2017 study found that people taking a vitamin D, calcium, and K2
                            supplement were 25% less likely to suffer fractures during their lifetime
                            (Schwalfenberg 2017).

                            Studies have found that high-dose vitamin K2 prevents fractures and sustains bone mineral density in osteoporosis
                            (Iwamoto 2009, Shiraki 2000).
                            Scientists found that 45 mg (45,000 mcg) per day was the optimal dose for improving bone mass
                            (Orimo 1992).
                            This is about 380-500 times greater than what is considered an adequate daily dietary intake (90-120 mcg)
                            (Harvard).
                            No toxic effects of vitamin K2 were reported
                            (Orimo 1992).

                            Note: Anyone taking warfarin should consult a physician before taking any form of vitamin K.
                            Warfarin blocks vitamin K activity in the body,
                            which means warfarin users must avoid vitamin K supplements and foods high in vitamin K.

                            Vitamin C plays a vital role in the production of proteins,
                            the development of bone-forming cells, and bone mineralization
                            (Zinnuroglu 2011, Hall 1998).
                            Vitamin C also suppresses bone-resorbing cell activity
                            while promoting bone-forming cell maturation
                            (Gabbay 2010).

                        <p>
                            Women with higher vitamin C intake have significantly better bone
                            mineral density when their calcium intake is above 500 mg/day
                            (Hall 1998).
                            Women who took vitamin C daily achieved stable bone mineral density
                            compared with placebo recipients, whose density dropped over six months
                            (Chuin 2009).
                            In another study, greater vitamin C intake was associated with a lower risk
                            of hip fracture, a 33% lower risk of osteoporosis, and higher bone density
                            (Malmir 2018).

                            And these benefits are not just for women.
                            In one study, 958 men and women were followed for 17 years.
                            Participants had 100 hip fractures during that time.
                            Subjects in the highest third of supplemental vitamin C intake had
                            significantly fewer hip fractures than subjects in the lowest third
                            (Sahni).
                            In another study with over 1400 people, vitamin C was positively
                            associated with bone density in young and early middle-aged men
                            (Lan 2022).

                            Bone remodeling is a tightly coordinated, lifelong process of
                            replacing old damaged bone with newly-synthesized healthy bone.
                            The imbalance between bone formation and degradation leads to osteoporosis.
                            Vitamin E has been extensively studied for its anti-osteoporotic properties
                            (Wong 2019)
                            and has been shown to have beneficial effects on bone formation and bone density
                            (Shuid 2019)

                            Alpha-Tocopherol is the predominant form of vitamin E in vitamin supplements, whereas gamma-tocopherol is the primary form of vitamin E in the US diet.
                            The gamma-tocopherol form of vitamin E is a better predictor of bone health than alpha-tocopherol.
                            Taking alpha-tocopherol can suppress gamma-tocopherol (Wolf) and may even adversely affect bone formation
                            (Hamidi 2012).

                        Crystals of calcium compounds give bone its hardness and strength.
                        Most Americans do not meet the daily adequate intake for calcium,

                    Calcium may also help us lose weight.
                    low calcium intake is associated with a high body
                    mass index (BMI) and high body fat percentage
                    (Bueno 2008).
                    In another study, overweight college students who took calcium
                    and vitamin D lost more body fat than those who did not

                    Experts recommend taking no more than 500 mg at a time
                    (Waldman 2015).

                        <p>
                            Magnesium, like calcium, makes up the mineral matrix of
                            bone and is needed to maintain healthy bone density
                            (Matsuzaki).
                            Sixty percent of our body's magnesium is stored in bone (Gr&ouml;ber).
                            A substantial number of people may be at risk for magnesium deficiency
                            (Rude 2004).
                            Older adults tend to be magnesium deficient because of reduced
                            dietary intake and absorption and increased urinary losses
                            (Barbagallo 2009).
                            Several studies have demonstrated that long-term magnesium deficiency results in bone loss.
                            One study found that 40% of women with osteoporosis or low bone density had low magnesium levels
                            (Mahdavi-Roshan).
                            Low magnesium intake and blood levels are associated with an increased risk of fractures
                            (Kunutsor, Veronese).

                    Magnesium supplementation in animal and human studies reduces bone turnover,
                    tending to favor bone formation over bone resorption
                    (Aydin 2010).
                    People who consume higher amounts of magnesium through their diet or
                    supplements have better bone mass density than those consuming lower amounts
                    (Orchard, Farsinejad-Marj, Abraham, Ryder).
                    A study of over 73,000 women found that women who consumed 400 mg of magnesium
                    per day had higher bone density than those who consumed half this amount
                    (Orchard).

                            Healthy bodies maintain a blood pH between 7.35-7.45.
                            This is one of the most tightly regulated setpoints in our bodies.
                            When it drops to the low end of this range, our blood is acidic, and our bodies fight to neutralize the acid.
                            Calcium is a base (opposite of acidic).
                            Our bodies dissolve some calcium from our bones to offset acidic blood.
                            If this situation is not corrected,
                            new bone formation is suppressed,
                            and there is an increase in urinary calcium excretion,
                            bone loss, and incidence of bone fracture
                            (Carnauba 2017).

                            Bicarbonate plays a big role in neutralizing acid.
                            As our bicarbonate supply gets depleted,
                            calcium is removed from bones and lost in the urine.
                            Potassium bicarbonate has been shown to lower calcium loss and reduce bone resorption
                            (Dawson-Hughes 2009, Sebastian 2005, Tylavsky 2008).

                    (MacDonald 2005, Green 1991).
                    A study involving 186 men and women from 23 to 76 years old showed that a diet high
                    in bicarbonate and potassium (The DASH diet) significantly reduces bone turnover
                    (Lin 2003). Nearly 98% of all adults in the United States do not get the recommended daily potassium intake
                    (Cogswell 2012).
                    Bone Safeguard supplies potassium and bicarbonate in the form of potassium bicarbonate.

                            While bone primarily comprises calcium, small amounts of other minerals are
                            essential for normal bone function and may reduce the risk of fractures.
                            These include silicon supplements, which reverse calcium loss
                            in the urine, increase bone density, and reduce fragility
                            (Price 2013, Li Z 2010, Spector 2008).
                            And boron, a trace element that reduces the excretion of calcium and magnesium in the kidneys
                            (Higgs, Price 2012),
                            and plays a critical role in bone growth and maintenance

                        Our bones are made mostly of calcium and 20%-30% protein.
                        A daily protein intake of about 60 grams is

                        Amino acids are the "building blocks" of protein.
                        There are about 20 amino acids that, assembled in various

                    Twins with higher intakes of alanine and glycine had
                    significantly higher bone density than their identical siblings.
                    In this analysis of 3160 women aged 18 to 79, intake of several other amino acids
                    (including arginine, leucine, and lysine)
                    was also associated with higher bone density.
                    People with higher intakes of these five amino acids

                    Our biochemistry is quite complex and involves many protective mechanisms,
                    which is why there are so many different ingredients in Alcohol Safeguard.
                    Our comprehensive study of the scientific literature has
                    helped us identify safe and effective evidence-based remedies.
