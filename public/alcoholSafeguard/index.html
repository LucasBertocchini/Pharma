                    The villain of our story is acetaldehyde (BOO!).
                    When we consume alcohol, our bodies convert it into acetaldehyde.
                    This nasty chemical is 30 times more toxic than alcohol itself.
                    It is closely related to formaldehyde (which is used for embalming cadavers)
                    and is a major cause of alcohol's unpleasant side effects and hangovers.
                    <br><br>
                    Acetaldehyde causes nearly all the damage to our brains and bodies that we blame on
                    alcohol-the skin wrinkling, artery hardening, liver damage, brain damage, cataracts,
                    decreased resistance to cancer and cardiovascular disease, premature aging, and hangover.
                    It does this by causing an abnormal chemical process called cross-linking.
                    This is the same process that converts (tans) soft cattle skin into hard, stiff leather.
                    Cross-linking is largely responsible for age-related changes
                    in human skin that make it inflexible, wrinkled, and dry.
                    <br><br>
                    Our hero is an enzyme called aldehyde dehydrogenase (YAY!).
                    It transforms the toxic acetaldehyde into harmless common vinegar.
                    But when we drink alcohol, acetaldehyde is made faster
                    than the heroic aldehyde enzyme can eliminate it.
                    We designed our formula to protect ourselves from
                    acetaldehyde toxicity and vanquish the villain.
                    We attack this problem from every angle by
                    combining a wide array of nutritional supplements.

                A scientist at the National Cancer Institute named Herbert Sprince, PhD.
                found that when rodents were given an "LD-90" dose of acetaldehyde
                (the amount that would typically kill 90% of the animals)
                and were also given vitamins B1 and C and cysteine,
                these toxic effects were blocked entirely-none of the treated
                animals succumbed to the deadly dose of acetaldehyde (Sprince 1975).
                <br><br>
                Another study found that taking cysteine resulted in a reduction in hangovers,
                nausea, and headache following alcohol consumption,
                as well as reduced stress and anxiety (Eriksson 2020).
                <br><br>
                Eggs are the best source of the amino acid cysteine,
                and orange juice is an excellent source of vitamin C.
                An old folk remedy for hangovers was to drop a raw egg
                into a glass of orange juice and attempt to swill it down.
                Now that we have discovered the active ingredients in eggs and OJ,
                we no longer have to resort to this revolting remedy!
                <br><br>
                We need to take about 200 mg of cysteine for every alcoholic
                drink to block most of the toxic effects of acetaldehyde.
                This is the amount of cysteine contained in each
                Alcohol Safeguard pill-plus the same amount of Vitamin C,
                which is required to keep the cysteine in its activated state and
                "on the job" against acetaldehyde (Eriksson 2020; McCarty 2013).

                Our livers are responsible for detoxifying alcohol.
                To function properly, the liver needs all known vitamins, minerals,
                and amino acids, plus special nutrients such as alpha lipoic acid.
                Some nutrients found in plants promote and even repair liver function.

                            Green tea is the best source of this amino acid.
                            It has been shown to protect our brains from alcohol by blocking free radicals,
                            counteracting the loss of glutathione, improving sleep, and breaking down acetaldehyde.
                            It can also make you feel less intoxicated.
                            When researchers gave theanine to mice, it reduced blood levels of alcohol (Sadzuka 2005).

                            It has anti-sickness properties that may help settle upset stomachs,
                            and it is an effective remedy for nausea (Palatty 2013).

                            Korean Red Ginseng is a medicinal plant historically used to treat fatigue,
                            increase energy, and build stamina and resilience (Kim 2013; Ong 2015).
                            Scientists gave 32 mg of ginseng extract to 25 healthy male whisky drinkers and
                            compared the results to the same level of alcohol consumption without ginseng.
                            Those who received ginseng showed lower levels of blood and breath alcohol,
                            and they experienced less fatigue, fewer cognitive symptoms, less thirst,
                            fewer stomach aches, and reduced hangover severity (Lee, Kwak 2014).
                            <br><br>
                            Findings from animal research show that ginseng reduces alcohol-related
                            tissue injury by inhibiting free radical activity and inflammation
                            (Li 2014; Gao 2015) and by increasing rates of alcohol and acetaldehyde
                            clearance from the body (Lee, Kim 2014).

                            Finally, we come to what may be the most important ingredient
                            in our formula: vine tree extract (dihydromyricetin).
                            The vine tree is a well-known and scientifically studied herb used for centuries in China,
                            Japan, and Korea, where it is taken to fight against liver disorders and as a hangover treatment.
                            Over 400 studies on its health benefits (viewable on PubMed)
                            show the degree of scientific interest in this extract and
                            its power against the side effects of alcohol.

            <p style="width: 75%; margin: auto;">
                In addition to protecting the liver against alcohol-related damage (Silva 2020),
                recent studies have shown that Vine Tree extract reduces loss of coordination,
                slow reaction time, and difficulty with verbal expression.
                It promotes the elimination of alcohol from our bodies and reduces alcohol-induced toxicity.
                It counteracts intoxication by slowing the absorption of
                alcohol and accelerating alcohol metabolization in the liver.
                And it helps our bodies break down acetaldehyde.
                <br><br>
                In one study, rats were injected with the equivalent of 20 beers.
                Untreated rats recovered within 90 minutes, but the animals treated
                with Vine Tree extract sobered up in 5 minutes (Shen, 2012).
                Another study discovered that Vine Tree extract reduces learning
                and memory impairment due to sleep deprivation (Li, 2019).
                <br><br>
                According to a study (Shen, 2012), the effective dosage of Vine Tree
                extract for hangovers is 70mg to 1050mg for a person weighing 150 pounds.
                A serving of Alcohol Safeguard (five capsules) has 1200mg.
                Vine Tree Extract is considered safe.
                No side effects have been reported, even in very large doses.
                <br><br>
                Note: beware of under-dosed formulations or ones that list dihydromyricetin as
                part of a "proprietary formula" without showing the actual amount in the mixture.
                Dihydromyricetin is expensive, and when the dosage is not explicitly listed,
                it is almost always included in minuscule amounts.

                    Glutathione is the body's primary acetaldehyde (and formaldehyde) detox agent.
                    It acts as an antioxidant, a free radical scavenger,
                    and it is sometimes referred to as "the master antioxidant".
                    Glutathione is composed of cysteine, glutamic acid, and glycine.
                    Our bodies do not readily absorb glutathione,
                    but we can make it by taking these three precursors.
                    Alcohol Safeguard supplies all three easily-absorbed glutathione
                    boosters-along with alpha-lipoic acid-another powerful antioxidant
                    that increases our body's ability to make glutathione and our cell's
                    ability to absorb cysteine (Chen 2013; Lee 2009; Sanders 1996).

                    Vitamin B1 is quickly destroyed by acetaldehyde.
                    A lack of Vitamin B1 has been shown to damage brain cells and cause lethargy,
                    fatigue, apathy, impaired awareness, loss of equilibrium, disorientation, and memory loss.
                    When vitamin B1 became available in an injectable form earlier last century,
                    interns discovered they could treat a hangover by injecting large doses.
                    <br><br>
                    Vitamin B1 is the most important B vitamin to take when consuming alcohol.
                    (Ambadath 2010), but alcohol depletes all the B vitamins, particularly vitamins
                    B3, B6, folic acid (Vitamin B9) (Medici 2013), and Vitamin B12 (Gibson 2008).
                    <br><br>
                    Vitamin B3 has been shown to significantly reduce hangover severity. (Verster 2019)
                </p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                A deficiency of vitamin B5 contributes to the hangover symptoms of headache, nausea, and fatigue.
                And Vitamin B5 is needed for processing acetaldehyde into vinegar.
                <br><br>
                Researchers found that people receiving vitamin B6 had significantly fewer hangover
                symptoms the following morning than did people receiving a placebo (Kahn 1973).
                <br><br>
                Another way acetaldehyde causes damage is by creating dangerous
                and reactive chemical fragments called free radicals (Han 2016).
                Our bodies must have an ample supply of antioxidants to neutralize these chemicals.
                Our formula includes generous amounts of free radical-controlling nutrients.
                Vitamins B1, B5, B6, C, E, and glutathione are all free radical scavengers,
                as is the zinc-dependent enzyme SOD (McCarty 2013; Das 2010).

                    Alcohol is a diuretic that causes our bodies to lose water (Hobson 2010).
                    And we lose electrolytes along with that water.
                    Electrolytes are minerals that carry an electric charge
                    and help with muscle, brain, and nerve function.
                    Common electrolytes include sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium
                    (all of which are included in our formula).
                    Electrolytes are crucial for the body's nerve responses,
                    muscle contractions, and water balance.
                    Low levels of potassium can cause feelings of weakness and shakiness.
                    Low magnesium levels can cause nerves to fire too easily - even from minor stimuli.
                    This can result in jangled nerves where even mild noises sound excessively loud,
                    lights seem too bright, and emotional reactions are exaggerated (Min 2010; Romani 2008).

                Selenium is needed for the proper function of glutathione.
                Heavy drinking reduces blood and liver selenium levels,

            The best way to use Alcohol Safeguard is to "preload" your body with one
            capsule before drinking and take an additional capsule for each drink consumed,
            plus (optionally) one before sleeping and another in the morning.
            <br><br>
            Our biochemistry is quite complex and involves many protective mechanisms,
            which is why there are so many different ingredients in Alcohol Safeguard.
            Our comprehensive study of the scientific literature has
            helped us identify safe and effective evidence-based remedies.
