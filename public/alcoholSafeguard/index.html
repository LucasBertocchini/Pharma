                        The villain of our story is acetaldehyde (BOO!).
                        When we consume alcohol, our bodies convert it into acetaldehyde.
                        This nasty chemical is 30 times more toxic than alcohol itself.
                        It is closely related to formaldehyde (which is used for embalming cadavers)
                        and is a major cause of alcohol's unpleasant side effects and hangovers.
                    </p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p style="margin: 64px;">
                        Acetaldehyde causes nearly all the damage to our brains and bodies that we blame on
                        alcohol-the skin wrinkling, artery hardening, liver damage, brain damage, cataracts,
                        decreased resistance to cancer and cardiovascular disease, premature aging, and hangover.
                        It does this by causing an abnormal chemical process called cross-linking.
                        This is the same process that converts (tans) soft cattle skin into hard, stiff leather.
                        Cross-linking is largely responsible for age-related changes
                        in human skin that make it inflexible, wrinkled, and dry.

                        Our hero is an enzyme called aldehyde dehydrogenase (YAY!).
                        It transforms the toxic acetaldehyde into harmless common vinegar.
                        But when we drink alcohol, acetaldehyde is made faster
                        than the heroic aldehyde enzyme can eliminate it.
                        We designed our formula to protect ourselves from
                        acetaldehyde toxicity and vanquish the villain.
                        We attack this problem from every angle by
                        combining a wide array of nutritional supplements.

                        A scientist at the National Cancer Institute named Herbert Sprince, PhD.
                        found that when rodents were given an "LD-90" dose of acetaldehyde
                        (the amount that would typically kill 90% of the animals)
                        and were also given vitamins B1 and C and cysteine,
                        these toxic effects were blocked entirely-none of the treated
                        animals succumbed to the deadly dose of acetaldehyde.

                        Another study found that taking cysteine resulted in a reduction in hangovers,
                        nausea, and headache following alcohol consumption,
                        as well as reduced stress and anxiety.

                        Eggs are the best source of the amino acid cysteine,
                        and orange juice is an excellent source of vitamin C.
                        An old folk remedy for hangovers was to drop a raw egg
                        into a glass of orange juice and attempt to swill it down.
                        Now that we have discovered the active ingredients in eggs and OJ,
                        we no longer have to resort to this revolting remedy!

                        We need to take about 200 mg of cysteine for every alcoholic
                        drink to block most of the toxic effects of acetaldehyde.
                        This is the amount of cysteine contained in each
                        Alcohol Safeguard pill-plus the same amount of Vitamin C,
                        which is required to keep the cysteine in its activated state and
                        "on the job" against acetaldehyde.

                        Vitamin B1 is quickly destroyed by acetaldehyde.
                        A lack of Vitamin B1 has been shown to damage brain cells and cause lethargy,
                        fatigue, apathy, impaired awareness, loss of equilibrium, disorientation, and memory loss.
                        When vitamin B1 became available in an injectable form earlier last century,
                        medical interns discovered they could treat a hangover by taking large doses.
                        <br><br>
                        Vitamin B1 is the most important B vitamin to take when consuming alcohol.

                    Vitamin B3 has been shown to significantly reduce hangover severity.

                    A deficiency of vitamin B5 contributes to the hangover symptoms of headache, nausea, and fatigue.
                    And Vitamin B5 is needed for processing acetaldehyde into vinegar.

                    Researchers found that people receiving vitamin B6 had significantly fewer hangover
                    symptoms the following morning than did people receiving a placebo.

                    Vitamin B6 is required for normal synthesis of both cysteine,

                    Another way acetaldehyde causes damage is by creating dangerous
                    and reactive chemical fragments called free radicals.

                    Our bodies must have an ample supply of antioxidants to neutralize these chemicals.
                    Our formula includes generous amounts of free radical-controlling nutrients.
                    Vitamins B1, B5, B6, C, E, and glutathione are all free radical scavengers,
                    as is the zinc-dependent enzyme SOD.

                        And we lose electrolytes along with that water.
                        Electrolytes are minerals that carry an electric charge
                        and help with muscle, brain, and nerve function.
                        Common electrolytes include sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium
                        (all of which are included in our formula).

                    Electrolytes are crucial for the body's nerve responses,
                    muscle contractions, and water balance.
                    Low levels of potassium can cause feelings of weakness and shakiness.
                    Low magnesium levels can cause nerves to fire too easily - even from minor stimuli.
                    This can result in jangled nerves where even mild noises sound excessively loud,
                    lights seem too bright, and emotional reactions are exaggerated.

                    Selenium is needed for the proper function of glutathione.
                    Heavy drinking reduces blood and liver selenium levels,
                    resulting in lower glutathione activity.

                        Glutathione is the body's primary acetaldehyde (and formaldehyde) detox agent.
                        It acts as an antioxidant, a free radical scavenger,
                        and it is sometimes referred to as "the master antioxidant".
                        Glutathione is composed of cysteine, glutamic acid, and glycine.
                        Our bodies do not readily absorb glutathione,
                        but we can make it by taking these three precursors.

                    boosters-along with alpha lipoic acid-another powerful antioxidant
                    that increases our body's ability to make glutathione and our cell's
                    ability to absorb cysteine.

                                Korean Red Ginseng is a medicinal plant historically used to treat fatigue,
                                increase energy, and build stamina and resilience.

                                Scientists gave 32 mg of ginseng extract to 25 healthy male whisky drinkers and
                                compared the results to the same level of alcohol consumption without ginseng.
                                Those who received ginseng showed lower levels of blood and breath alcohol,
                                and they experienced less fatigue, fewer cognitive symptoms, less thirst,
                                fewer stomach aches, and reduced hangover severity.

                                Finally, we come to what may be the most important ingredient
                                in our formula: vine tree extract (dihydromyricetin).
                                The vine tree is a well-known and scientifically studied herb used for centuries in China,
                                Japan, and Korea, where it is taken to fight against liver disorders and as a hangover treatment.
                                Over 400 studies on its health benefits (viewable on PubMed)
                                show the degree of scientific interest in this extract and
                                its power against the side effects of alcohol.

                    recent studies have shown that Vine Tree extract reduces loss of coordination,
                    slow reaction time, and difficulty with verbal expression.
                    It promotes the elimination of alcohol from our bodies and reduces alcohol-induced toxicity.
                    It counteracts intoxication by slowing the absorption of
                    alcohol and accelerating alcohol metabolization in the liver.
                    And it helps our bodies break down acetaldehyde.

                    with Vine Tree extract sobered up in 5 minutes.

                    the effective dosage of Vine Tree
                    extract for hangovers is 70mg to 1050mg for a person weighing 150 pounds.
                    A serving of Alcohol Safeguard (five capsules) has 1200mg.
                    Vine Tree Extract is considered safe.
                    No side effects have been reported, even in very large doses.

                    part of a "proprietary formula" without showing the actual amount in the mixture.
                    Dihydromyricetin is expensive, and when the dosage is not explicitly listed,
                    it is almost always included in minuscule amounts.

                    The best way to use Alcohol Safeguard is to "preload" your body with one
                    capsule before drinking and take an additional capsule for each drink consumed,
                    plus (optionally) one before sleeping and another in the morning.
                    <br><br>
                    Our biochemistry is quite complex and involves many protective mechanisms,
                    which is why there are so many different ingredients in Alcohol Safeguard.
                    Our comprehensive study of the scientific literature has
                    helped us identify safe and effective evidence-based remedies.
